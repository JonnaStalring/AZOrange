\title{\normalfont{Molecular standardization}}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

The molecular standardization processes of ChemAxon's Standardizer and the Open Source library MolVS have been evaluated 
on a test suit of 35 compounds containing tautomers, mesomers and functional groups that are often represented differently. 
The 35 compounds are represented in multiple forms that, from a chemoinformatic perspective, should ideally be transformed 
into the same representation by the standardization process. 
However, the standardization process in Standardizer is not intended to transform into one canonical tautomer, but 
produces so called normal canonical tautomers where the normal canonical tautomer is selected from from subsets of 
tautomers considered interchangeable under physiological conditions. 

For each method a table is produced showing the input and output structures as drawn by RDKit for the different forms.
The table also displays two fingerprint similarities between all pairs of output structures. If the standardization 
is successful the fingerprints should be identical. Furthermore, the set of 177 RDKit descriptors is calculated 
for each output structure and the number of differing descriptors is reported for each pair of output structures.


%\section{Results Summary}
%ChemAxon's Standardizer fails to identify the different forms of 14 out of the 35 structures as similar, while MolVS fails 
%for 3 structures. The failures of MolVS are all for certain functional groups, nitro, phosphine and diazo, while 
%Standardizer fails in the canonicalization of 9 tautomers, as well as for 5 functional groups. 

%As shown in the tables below, most of the standardization failures result in significant loss of fingerprint similarity 
%and a large number of RDKit descriptors with different values. Hence, the failures will have an impact on the results of 
%chemoinformatic analysis. 


\section{Standardization with ChemAxon Standardizer }

The ChemAxon standardizer was used with 7 actions, applied in the following order, together with the set of transformations defined in the GUI:
\begin{itemize} 
\item removesolvents
\item stripsalts 
\item removefragment:method=keeplargest
\item mesomerize
\item tautomerize
\item neutralize
\item transformations
\item dearomatize
\end{itemize} 
%Two out of the failures to transform functional groups (Idx 7 and 35) originates from RDKit being unable to accept the valence of the structures 
%returned by Standardizer. The output structure of molecule 7 is displayed below.

\section{Additional standardization with MolVS}

In addition to running Standardizer by ChemAxon, the canonicalize and uncharge options of MolVS were used.
